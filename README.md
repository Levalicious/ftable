# ftable
A decently fast hash table written in C based on https://probablydance.com/2017/02/26/i-wrote-the-fastest-hashtable/.

Thanks to Malte Skarupke for the writeup of his implementation.

This uses a prime modulus, at some point I might attempt using fibonacci hashing as recommended by Skarupke.
